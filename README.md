# IOT-controlled-Robot
The main objective was to create a internet controlled robot to get information about what is happening in an area while the user of it would not present on that particular location
.But later we added a new part called an PIR sensor that help an user when he is unable to control the robot but it remains on its duty.To control the robot we used a Raspberry Pi 3 model B to extract the user input and pass the information to Arduino.Arduino holds the main controlling part of the robot and accompanied by other controlling device such as motor driver and dc motor it does it jobs.The streaming part is controlled by Raspberry Pi and for better streaming we used a video Server to get the less delay. Finally for Sensing part we used PIR sensor wholely controlled by Raspberry Pi.

The description of the whole project is discussed on project.doc file.
